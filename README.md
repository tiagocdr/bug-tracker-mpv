# Bug Tracking System By Santiago Toro



Welcome to BugTracker Project, project where its main purpose is for project managers and administrators can track application development, specifically categorize and keep a record of new-found bugs in the app and giving the developers, testers and other authorized employees to identify them and also provide details about them.

Developed using Python and Django as the framework, for easy scalability and seemless database implementation, and a little bit of HTML and CSS tricks with the intention to make it look like a modern, easy to navigate site.
